# Cookies Are OK

*Cookies Are OK* is a filter that blocks [the majority of] Cookie Consent messages. To enable it, add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrazyPython/I-Consent-to-Cookies/master/filter.txt` to your Adblocker's list of custom filters. 

If you don't have an adblocker, I recommend [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock), for it's performance and wide-spectrum blocking. Not sponsored.

Please report bugs and unblocked sites in GitHub Issues.
